# Machine Learning
We use machine learning to make predictions around the data we have.

## Supervised Learning
When we have a set of data and provide with x **the input** and y **the label**. The goal for the model is to create relationship so that it can label data it hasn't seen before

- Regression
  Predicting a continuous number. Eg. predicting a house price
- Classification
  Predicting a discrete category. Eg. predicting if an email is spam or not

## Unsupervised Learning
We provide the computer only the inputs and let it set labels based on patterns and structures

- Clustering
  Grouping similar data points together. Eg classifying movies based on category
- Dimensionality Reduction
  Simplifying complex data.
