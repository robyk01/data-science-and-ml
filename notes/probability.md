# Probability
## Basic Probability

### The Basics: P(A)
Probability is always a number between 0 and 1 (0% to 100%)
Probability = Ways it can happen / Total possible outcomes

### The 'and' vs 'or' Rules
#### The 'or' Rule (Addition):
If you want to know the probability of A or B, you just add the probabilities.
Eg. Chance of rolling a 1 (1/6) or a 2 (1/6) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 (33%)

#### The 'and' Rule
If you want to know the probability of A and B, you just multiply the probabilities.
Eg chance of rolling a 1 and then rolling another 1 = 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36 (2.7%)

### Independent vs Dependent Events
**Independent**: One event won't change the next. Eg. flipping a coin
**Dependent**: One event does change the next. Eg. Drawing an Ace from a deck and keeping it. Trying to get another Ace will will be smaller because there's fewer Aces.

### Bayes' Theorem:
**P(A|B) = P(B∣A)×P(A) / P(B)
